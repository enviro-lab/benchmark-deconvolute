# Tool use and scripting notes

## Contents of this directory
For each tool, we've included:
* a README explaining the steps we took to get our results
* the scripts used to run the deconvolution for each of our batches of samples
* the outputs for each plate in their original form and aggregated to match the freyja demix output style

## Running these scripts
There are several considerations that may make it tricky to run our scripts, but hopefully this explains most everything. Feel free to reach out with any questions or if any issues occur.
1. The scripts here have been edited to the best of our ability to fit paths with those in this repo, but the scripts have not been tested here.
2. We haven't included our actual results in the [ont](../ont/) directory. Our filtered fastqs can be downloaded from NCBI as described in [ont/README.md](../ont/README.md).
